# 🖊️ AI-Assisted Collaborative Diagramming Tool

# 📌 Overview

This project is a real-time, web-based collaborative whiteboard that allows multiple users to draw diagrams together.
The standout feature is an AI-assisted cleanup system powered by heuristics, which automatically recognizes and refines messy sketches into clean, structured diagrams (e.g., circles, rectangles, arrows, and lines).

✨ Features

📝 Freehand drawing on a shared canvas.

🤝 Real-time collaboration (multi-user support).

🧠 AI-assisted diagram cleanup using heuristics:

Circle detection & smoothing

Rectangle snapping
